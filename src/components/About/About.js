          <p>I was born in 1983 in Lule√• in the very northern parts of Sweden.
             Growing up under the cold winters majestic northern ligths and the
             bright midnight sun, creative striving grew.
             My jewellery comes from hidden desires, vivid dreams and distant
             memories. Often influenced by old craftsmanship traditions.
