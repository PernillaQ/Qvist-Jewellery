        <p> My name is Pernilla Qvist and I am a contemporary silversmith and jeweler.<br />
            I was born in 1983 in Lule√• in the very northern parts of Sweden.
            Growing up under the cold winters majestic northern ligths and the
            bright midnight sun, creative striving grew.  <br />
            As a child I found something on a dusty workshop floor, that would be the beginning of a great love.
            I still remember how the smell of iron made me nauseous.
            It was a welding residual and it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.<br/>
            My jewellery comes from hidden desires, vivid dreams and distant
            memories. Often influenced by old craftsmanship traditions.
